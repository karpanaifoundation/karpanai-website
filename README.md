# Karpanai Foundation — Website

A static, playful "sketchbook" themed website for Karpanai Foundation, built with plain HTML, CSS and jQuery. No build tools or frameworks required — ready to deploy straight to GitHub Pages.

## What's inside

```
karpanai/
├── index.html              Home
├── our-story/index.html     Our Story / About
├── what-we-do/index.html    Programmes
├── impact/index.html        Impact & stats
├── stories/index.html       Stories from the Studio (+ drawing canvas)
├── get-involved/index.html  Partner / Volunteer / Facilitate / Support
├── donate/index.html        Donate
├── contact/index.html       Contact form
├── css/style.css            Full design system (colours, type, components)
├── js/main.js               All jQuery interactions
└── assets/logo.jpg          Karpanai logo
```

Each inner page lives in its own folder as `index.html` so it serves at a clean, extension-less URL (e.g. `/contact/` instead of `/contact.html`).

## Design notes

- **Palette:** Deep Ink Blue `#172B4D`, Karpanai Yellow `#F4C542`, Warm Paper `#FFFDF5`, Charcoal `#171717`, with a muted coral `#E8734A` used sparingly for artwork and interactive accents — drawn from the existing Karpanai logo and brand.
- **Type:** *Fredoka* for headings, *Caveat* (handwritten) for playful annotations/eyebrows, *Inter* for body copy.
- **Signature elements:** hand-drawn doodle underlines that draw themselves in on scroll, tilted "sketchbook" cards, a hand-drawn subject picker on the homepage, a flip-card "Method" explainer, and a freehand drawing canvas on the Stories page ("What would you create if you could change one thing?").
- All interactivity (mobile nav, scroll reveals, animated counters, subject picker, flip cards, story filters, copy-to-clipboard, canvas drawing, contact form) is written in `js/main.js` using jQuery — no build step needed.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `karpanai-website`).
2. Push the contents of this folder to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Karpanai Foundation website"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Under **Branch**, choose `main` and folder `/ (root)`, then **Save**.
6. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` within a minute or two.

No further configuration is needed — every link in the site is a relative path (`./`, `../css/style.css`, etc.), so it works the same locally, on Pages, or on any static host.

## Things to fill in before launch

- `donate/index.html` — real UPI ID, bank account details, IFSC, and a donation QR code image (currently placeholders).
- `contact/index.html` — the contact form is a button linking out to Google Forms (`https://forms.gle/n31mEGHjFD6ANVn47`). To point it at a different form, update that link's `href`.
- Swap in real photography/artwork where the SVG doodles are used as placeholders, if you'd like a more photographic feel.
- `assets/logo.jpg` — replace with a transparent PNG/SVG version of the logo if available, for cleaner rendering on colored backgrounds.

## Local preview

Because the interactions use `fetch`-free, plain relative paths, you can just double-click `index.html` — or, for the best experience (and to avoid any browser file:// quirks), serve it locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
